I am a research associate in the [Mahadevan Group](https://mahadevan.whoi.edu/) at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. My work is motivated by the question of how clouds interact with the upper ocean -- a big question that leads to broad interests. I spend a lot of my time out in nature looking for cool clouds and plants and birds. [Take a look at my blog](https://cloudlooks.substack.com) to see what I've been finding lately. 

My PhD work was in string theory. My thesis on M-theory/heterotic duality was advised by [Professor David Morrison](http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~drm/), and I was a member of the [Simons Collaboration on Special Holonomy in Geometry, Analysis, and Physics](https://sites.duke.edu/scshgap/). I was previously a [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/), and before that I completed my BSc in physics and mathematics at Stanford University.
