**Quantum Gravity and Holography**

Before specializing to string theory, I studied more general aspects of quantum gravity from the point of view of holography and the gravitational path integral.
- **Observables in AdS:** With [Steve Giddings](http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~giddings/), I studied diffeomorphism-invariant observables in anti-de Sitter spacetimes and the role of gravitational dressings in holography. You can view the paper in JHEP [here](https://doi.org/10.1007/JHEP11(2018)074) or the arXiv preprint [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01602).
- **Wormhole Instantons:** With [Sean Hartnoll](https://sitp.stanford.edu/people/sean-hartnoll), I completed an undergraduate honors thesis on the perturbations about an axionic wormhole gravitational instanton, which can be viewed [here](/files/thesis.pdf).

**Earthquake Seismology**

Throughout my undergraduate degree, I conducted research in earthquake seismology. These formative years cemented my passion for the earth sciences. 
- **Rough Faults:** With [Eric Dunham](https://pangea.stanford.edu/~edunham/), I investigated the effects of fault roughness on the radiation pattern of earthquakes. This work was supported by a Stanford Undergraduate Research Major Grant.
- **Soil-Structure Interaction:** With [Eric Dunham](https://pangea.stanford.edu/~edunham/), I studied the fully-coupled interaction of seismic waves with buildings in an idealized model. This work was presented at the 2013 Southern California Earthquake Center Annual Meeting. Click [here](/files/SCEC.png) for the poster.
- **Mantle Anisotropy:** With [Simon Klemperer](https://earth.stanford.edu/people/simon-klemperer) and Shahar Barak, I studied mantle anisotropy via shear wave splitting observed in the Salton Trough in Southern California. This work was presented at the AGU 2012 Annual Meeting, and the poster can be viewed [here](/files/AGU2012).
