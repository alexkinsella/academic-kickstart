**Physical Oceanography and Biogeochemistry**

My primary research interest is in the effects of ocean circulation and biogeochemistry on the large-scale dynamics of Earth's climate. My current work explores ocean circulation locally in the Santa Barbara channel, as well as how flexible nutrient ratios in the biological pump affects the global distribution of dissolved inorganic carbon. Current projects:
- **Santa Barbara Channel Dynamics:** With [Nick Nidzieko](https://ucsbcoastlab.org/nick-nidzieko/) and [Alex Fisher](https://alexanderwfisher.com/), I am studying the coupled ocean-atmosphere dynamics of the Santa Barbara Channel via analysis of ROMS/NAM model output and observational data.
- **Flexible Nutrient Ratios:** With [Tim DeVries](https://tdevries.eri.ucsb.edu/), I am implementing flexible nutrient uptake stoichiometries for phytoplankton in a global ocean circulation inverse model.

**M-theory/heterotic Duality**

As part of the [Simons Collaboration for Special Holonomy in Geometry, Analysis, and Physics](https://sites.duke.edu/scshgap/), I work at the intersection of mathematics and physics to incorporate new research on special holonomy spaces into string theory constructions. My dissertation studies the duality between M-theory on $G_2$ manifolds and the $E_8 \times E_8$ heterotic string on Calabi-Yau threefolds. At low energies, each side of this duality gives an effective $N=1$ supersymmetric description of our universe, and in favorable situations, the background geometry and bundles may be chosen in a way that the two descriptions coincide. My work explores this correspondence both on orbifolds and in local models of the relevant geometries. Current projects:
- **Duality on Orbifolds:** With [David Morrison](http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~drm/) and [Bobby Acharya](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/bobby-acharya), I am studying how M-theory/heterotic duality behaves in the case of the half-$G_2$ limit of a Joyce orbifold. I presented progress on this work at the 2019 Simons Collaboration meeting on Physics and Special Holonomy. The video can be viewed [here](https://sites.duke.edu/scshgap/alex-kinsella-lectures/#11apr19) and the slides can be viewed [here](/files/Mhet.pdf).
- **The Reduced Hull-Strominger System:** With [Eirik Eik Svanes](https://sites.google.com/view/eesvanes/) and [Bobby Acharya](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/bobby-acharya), I am studying solutions to the Hull-Strominger system reduced to the 3D base of a local model of a Calabi-Yau threefold. A preprint will be available soon on arXiv.
