I am a physicist fascinated by the Earth, Universe, and Nature. My current research is in physical oceanography, but my PhD training was in string theory, a subfield of high energy theoretical physics.  While the two disciplines may at first seem to be a world apart, I am fascinated by the way that both string theory and oceanography describe enormous, unintuitive structures that govern the conditions of our human lives. Beyond my natural interest in the beauty of geophysical fluid dynamics, I am motivated to action by the looming threats engendered by anthropogenic global warming. I intend to contribute to a powerful societal response to climate change by furthering our understanding of how the ocean interacts with Earthâ€™s climate.
